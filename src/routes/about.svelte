			<strong>RECENT CHANGES 1.29.21: New remote and self care resources</strong>
			<p>
				I've created a new page for those of you working remotely for the first time, or those who
				need some new perspectives on self care as remote workers.

			<h2>About this site</h2>
			<p>
				A while back I had a minor wake up call. I wasn't taking care of myself and and my body told
				me so in no uncertain terms. The experience started me thinking about how important self
				care is, and how little we pay attention to it in the tech community.
			</p>
			<p>
				So often I see developers ignoring their basic needs for rest and refreshment. I started
				this site to provide a central location to find links that will help us all take better care
				of ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not a developer or involved in tech? You deserve to take time for self-care, too! You don't
				have to be in tech to contribute and use these links.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also wrote a post on medium to dig a little deeper into why I made this site:

					I made a few bots if you'd like to follow them. There are reminders for selfcare practice
