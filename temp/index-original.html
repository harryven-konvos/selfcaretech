          not that long ago, i had a minor wake up call. i wasn't taking care of myself and and my body told me so in no uncertain terms. the experience started me thinking about how important self care is, and how little we pay attention to it in the tech community.
        </p>
        <p>
          so often i see my fellow developers ignoring their basic needs for rest and refreshment. i started this site to provide a central location to find links that will help us all take better care of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          not a developer or involved in tech? you still deserve to take time for self-care, too! you don't have to be in tech to contribute and use these links.
