Short description:  Konvos is a self-exploration app inspired by voice journaling. The app enablesindividuals to question their bias when it comes to their emotions. It's a sort of "talk to the duck" tool for emotions to face disruptive emotonal moments - to figure out what underlying beliefs are triggering our feelings and then go about transforming "disruptive" emotions into something that's more constructive.
